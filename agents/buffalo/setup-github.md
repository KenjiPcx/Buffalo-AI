# Setting up Buffalo AI on GitHub

## Option 1: Using GitHub Web Interface (Recommended)

1. **Go to GitHub and create a new repository:**
   - Visit: https://github.com/new
   - Repository name: `buffalo-ai` (or your preferred name)
   - Description: `AI-powered browser testing agent with parallel automation and multi-agent orchestration`
   - Choose Public or Private
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

2. **Push your local repository:**
   ```bash
   # Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username
   # Replace REPO_NAME with your chosen repository name
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Option 2: Using GitHub CLI (if you have it installed)

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI first if needed:
# brew install gh  # macOS
# Or download from: https://cli.github.com/

# Login to GitHub
gh auth login

# Create repository and push
gh repo create buffalo-ai --public --description "AI-powered browser testing agent with parallel automation and multi-agent orchestration" --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

## After Setting Up

1. **Add repository topics/tags** (optional):
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click the gear icon next to "About"
   - Add topics: `ai`, `browser-automation`, `testing`, `playwright`, `docker`, `python`, `multi-agent`

2. **Set up repository settings:**
   - Enable Issues if you want bug tracking
   - Set up branch protection rules if needed
   - Configure Actions if you want CI/CD

## Repository Structure

Your repository will include:
- üê≥ **Complete Docker setup** with Ubuntu + Playwright
- ü§ñ **AI browser automation** using Gemini LLM
- ‚ö° **Parallel test execution** with worker pools
- üîÑ **Multi-agent orchestration** via Coral framework
- üìö **Comprehensive documentation** and examples
- üõ†Ô∏è **Build scripts** and development tools

## Next Steps

After pushing to GitHub, you can:
1. Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
2. Create releases for version management
3. Add collaborators if working in a team
4. Set up issue templates for bug reports
5. Create a project board for task management
