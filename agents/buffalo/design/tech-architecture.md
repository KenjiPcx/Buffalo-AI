## Agent Architecture

### Buffalo Agent (Browser Automation)
**Purpose**: Execute browser-based tests using AI-driven automation

**Technology Stack**:
- Language: Python
- LLM: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash
- Browser Automation: browser-use library
- Communication: Coral MCP client
- Database: Convex client

**Responsibilities**:
1. Receive test requests from Coral network
2. Query test definitions from Convex
3. Execute browser automation tasks
4. Report results back to Convex
5. Send completion notifications via Coral

**Tools**:
- `get_tests_by_website`: Retrieve test definitions
- `upsert_tests`: Manage test templates
- `start_test_session`: Execute test batches

### Test Planner Agent (Planned)
**Purpose**: Intelligently generate test cases by analyzing web applications

**Planned Capabilities**:
1. **Discovery Phase**
   - Crawl application pages
   - Build site map
   - Identify user flows

2. **Analysis Phase**
   - Extract interactive elements
   - Determine element relationships
   - Identify critical paths

3. **Generation Phase**
   - Create comprehensive test cases
   - Define assertions and validations
   - Prioritize test execution order

4. **Validation Phase**
   - Execute generated tests
   - Verify expected outcomes
   - Refine test accuracy

## Real-time Progress Monitoring

### Implementation
- **Convex Subscriptions**: Live updates from database
- **Progress Tracking**: Batch completion status
- **Result Streaming**: Test results appear as completed
- **Error Reporting**: Immediate failure notifications

### State Management
```typescript
// TestSession States
- pending: Session created, tests queued
- running: Tests executing in batches
- completed: All tests finished
- failed: Session encountered critical error

// TestExecution States
- pending: Test queued for execution
- running: Currently executing
- passed: Test succeeded
- failed: Test failed with errors
```

## Security Considerations

### Current State
- [ ] No authentication on Convex queries/mutations
- [ ] Open Coral agent communication
- [ ] Unencrypted test results

### Planned Security
- [ ] API key authentication for Convex
- [ ] Agent identity verification
- [ ] Encrypted test data storage
- [ ] Rate limiting on test execution
- [ ] Sandboxed browser environments

## Performance Optimizations

### Implemented
- [x] Parallel test execution (5 concurrent)
- [x] Batch processing for efficiency
- [x] Async/await throughout stack

### Planned
- [ ] Dynamic batch sizing based on complexity
- [ ] Test result caching
- [ ] Browser instance pooling
- [ ] Distributed agent scaling
- [ ] Smart test prioritization
