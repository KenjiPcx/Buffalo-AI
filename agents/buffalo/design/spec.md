# VibeCheck - Pre-Launch Confidence for Vibe-Coded Apps

## Problem Statement

Non-technical founders using AI to build apps ("vibe coders") face a critical confidence gap at launch. They've built features on a whim using AI tools like Cursor, v0, or Bolt, but have zero testing infrastructure. Unlike traditional developers who write tests, vibe coders have no way to verify their app actually works before hitting "deploy."

**Current Pain Points:**

- **Launch Anxiety**: "Will my checkout flow actually work when real users try it?"
- **Manual Testing Gaps**: Clicking through manually misses edge cases and broken states
- **No Technical Validation**: Can't read error logs or understand stack traces
- **Reputation Risk**: Launching broken features damages credibility with early users
- **Time Waste**: Finding bugs post-launch means scrambling to fix while users leave

## User Stories

### Story 1: The Anxious Launcher

**As a** solopreneur who just built my first SaaS using AI tools

**I want to** know if my app's core features actually work

**So that** I can launch with confidence instead of anxiety

**Current Struggle:** Sarah built a scheduling app using Cursor. She's manually clicked through the main flow 10 times, but she's terrified she missed something. She can't write tests and doesn't know what edge cases to check.

**Loss from Old Approach:** Launches anyway, discovers the timezone selection breaks for mobile users, loses 40% of early signups.

**Promise of Solution:** One click gives Sarah a comprehensive report showing her scheduling flow works across devices, but the timezone picker fails on mobile Safari.

### Story 2: The Feature Shipper

**As a** vibe coder rapidly iterating on features

**I want to** verify new features don't break existing ones

**So that** I can ship fast without breaking things

**Current Struggle:** Marcus adds a new payment tier to his app. He tests the new tier manually but doesn't retest all existing flows.

**Loss from Old Approach:** New tier works, but the change broke the free tier signup. Doesn't notice for 3 days.

**Promise of Solution:** After adding the feature, runs VibeCheck which tests ALL flows in parallel, immediately catching the regression.

### Story 3: The Non-Technical Founder

**As a** founder without coding knowledge

**I want to** understand what's broken in plain English

**So that** I can communicate fixes to AI tools or freelancers

**Current Struggle:** Jennifer's app throws errors, but she doesn't understand "TypeError: Cannot read property 'value' of null"

**Loss from Old Approach:** Sends cryptic errors to ChatGPT, gets generic advice, wastes days on wrong fixes.

**Promise of Solution:** Gets report saying "Your contact form fails because the email field doesn't exist on mobile view" with screenshots.

## Solution Overview

VibeCheck is an AI-powered testing platform that automatically validates vibe-coded apps before launch. Using Coral's multi-agent framework, it deploys a swarm of specialized browser agents that explore, test, and report on app functionality - all without requiring any technical knowledge or test writing.

### Core Value Proposition

**"Testing without writing tests"** - Get the confidence of a QA team without the complexity.

### How It Works

1. **Paste URL** - User provides their app URL
2. **AI Explores** - Agents understand what the app does
3. **Swarm Tests** - Multiple agents test flows in parallel
4. **Plain English Report** - Actionable findings without technical jargon

## Feature Specification
